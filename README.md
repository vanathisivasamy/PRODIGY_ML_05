# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a model designed to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The primary objective is to empower users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices by leveraging image recognition technology.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the food recognition and calorie estimation model is sourced from Kaggle. It includes a collection of labeled images of various food items, along with corresponding calorie information.

## Model Used
We have implemented a deep learning model for food recognition and calorie estimation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for image-related tasks, and the model will be trained to recognize the visual features of different food items. Additionally, a regression model will be employed to estimate the calorie content based on the recognized food item.

The model's performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and it can be fine-tuned for improved accuracy.
